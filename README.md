# Basic-Student-Management-System
Created a GUI-based project for managing the student records and performing various CRUD operations on them. 
Technologies used included Python language, Oracle database and libraries like tkinter, matplotlib, pandas, bs4,
pil, etc.
Live weather & location details were displayed at the front-end, records were maintained and studentsâ€™
performance was compared graphically.
Data extraction and Data visualisation was done using bs4 and matplotlib respectively.

NOTE: Create a table using query:
      create table student(no int primary key, name varchar(20), phy int, che int, mat int, sum int)
